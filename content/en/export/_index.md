To request an export, click on the export schedule button.
Depending on the server load and the number of documents, this processing can
take a while.

Once finished, you have the possibility to download the export archive.

This archive contains all your documents.
The format is simple and reusable for other needs than import.

However, the import is a manual procedure.
For the moment, only the administrator is authorized to import an archive.
