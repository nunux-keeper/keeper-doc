A bookmarklet is a tiny application stored as a bookmark in the web browser.
It allows the user to interact with the current page.

In the case of Nunux Keeper, the bookmarklet allows you to save all or part of
the page.

You can find the bookmarklet in the first tab of the `settings` page.
The installation is simple.
You just have to drag and drop the `Keep This!` button into your browser's
bookmarks bar.

Now you can, at any time while browsing any web site, click on this bookmark
and trigger the bookmarklet.

  Drag and drop the image you are interested in onto the bookmaklet and click on
  it.

Once the document has been created, you can click on the bookmarklet again to
